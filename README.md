## Users
Users are able to view meet results and  inidividual lifter results, and also use the unit converter from lb to kg. 

## Admin
Admin users are able to upload CSV files. The system will automatically check the validity of the results (such as making sure the lifter's age matches their age group) and fix errors.
Once complete, the admin user will be given a list of changes from the uploaded CSV (if any), and the database will be automatically update.
